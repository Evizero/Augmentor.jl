# Background and Motivation

In this section we will discuss the concept of image augmentation
in general. In particular we will introduce some terminology and
useful definitions.

## What is Image Augmentation?

The term *data augmentation* is commonly used to describe the
process of repeatedly applying various transformations to some
dataset, with the hope that the output (i.e. the newly generated
observations) bias the model towards learning better features.
Depending on the structure and semantics of the data, coming up
with such transformations can be a challenge by itself.

Images are a special class of data that exhibit some interesting
properties in respect to their structure. For example the
dimensions of an image (i.e. the pixel) exhibit a spatial
relationship to each other. As such, a lot of commonly used
augmentation strategies for image data revolve around affine
transformations, such as translations or rotations. Because
images are so popular and special case of data, they deserve
their own sub-category of data augmentation, which we will
unsurprisingly refer to as **image augmentation**.

The general idea is the following: if we want our model to
generalize well, then we should design the learning process in
such a way as to bias the model into learning such
transformation-[equivariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map)
properties. One way to do this is via
the design of the model itself, which for example was idea behind
convolutional neural networks. An orthogonal approach to bias the
model to learn about this equivariance - and the focus of this
package - is by using label-preserving transformations.

## [Label-preserving Transformations](@id labelpreserving)

Before attempting to train a model using some augmentation
pipeline, it's a good idea to invest some time in deciding on an
appropriate set of transformations to choose from. Some of these
transformations also have parameters to tune, and we should also
make sure that we settle on a decent set of values for those.

What constitutes as "decent" depends on the dataset. In general
we want the augmented images to be fairly dissimilar to the
originals. However, we need to be careful that the augmented
images still visually represent the same concept (and thus
label). If a pipeline only produces output images that have this
property we call this pipeline **label-preserving**.

### [Example: MNIST Handwritten Digits](@id mnist)

Consider the following example from the MNIST database of
handwritten digits [^MNIST1998]. Our input image clearly
represents its associated label "6". If we were to use the
transformation [`Rotate180`](@ref) in our augmentation pipeline
for this type of images, we could end up with the situation
depicted by the image on the right side.

```@example
using Augmentor, MLDatasets
input_img  = MNIST.convert2image(MNIST.traintensor(19))
output_img = augment(input_img, Rotate180())
using Images, FileIO; # hide
upsize(A) = repeat(A, inner=(4,4)); # hide
save(joinpath("assets","bg_mnist_in.png"), upsize(input_img)); # hide
save(joinpath("assets","bg_mnist_out.png"), upsize(output_img)); # hide
nothing # hide
```

Input (`input_img`)              | Output (`output_img`)
---------------------------------|------------------------------------
![input](assets/bg_mnist_in.png) | ![output](assets/bg_mnist_out.png)

To a human, this newly transformed image clearly represents the
label "9", and not "6" like the original image did. In image
augmentation, however, the assumption is that the output of the
pipeline has the same label as the input. That means that in this
example we would tell our model that the correct answer for the
image on the right side is "6", which is clearly undesirable for
obvious reasons.

Thus, for the MNIST dataset, the transformation
[`Rotate180`](@ref) is **not** label-preserving and should not be
used for augmentation.

### Example: ISIC Skin Lesions

On the other hand, the exact same transformation could very well
be label-preserving for other types of images. Let us take a look
at a different set of image data; this time from the medical
domain.

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration [^ISIC] hosts a
large collection of publicly available and labeled skin lesion
images. A subset of that data was used in 2016's ISBI challenge
[^ISBI2016] where a subtask was lesion classification.

Let's consider the following input image on the left side. It
shows a photo of a skin lesion that was taken from above. By
applying the [`Rotate180`](@ref) operation to the input image, we
end up with a transformed version shown on the right side.

```@example
using Augmentor, ISICArchive
input_img  = get(ImageThumbnailRequest(id = "5592ac599fc3c13155a57a85"))
output_img = augment(input_img, Rotate180())
using FileIO; # hide
save(joinpath("assets","bg_isic_in.png"), input_img); # hide
save(joinpath("assets","bg_isic_out.png"), output_img); # hide
nothing # hide
```

Input (`input_img`)             | Output (`output_img`)
--------------------------------|-----------------------------------
![input](assets/bg_isic_in.png) | ![output](assets/bg_isic_out.png)

After looking at both images, one could argue that the
orientation of the camera is somewhat arbitrary as long as it
points to the lesion at an approximately orthogonal angle. Thus,
for the ISIC dataset, the transformation [`Rotate180`](@ref)
could be considered as label-preserving and very well be tried
for augmentation. Of course this does not guarantee that it will
improve training time or model accuracy, but the point is that it
is unlikely to hurt.
