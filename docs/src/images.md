# Working with Images in Julia

The [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) provides a rich
syntax as well as large set of highly-optimized functionality for
working with (multi-dimensional) arrays of what is known as "bit
types" or compositions of such. Because of this, the language
lends itself particularly well to the fairly simple idea of
treating images as just plain arrays. Even though this may sound
as a rather tedious low-level approach, Julia makes it possible
to still allow for powerful abstraction layers without the loss
of generality that usually comes with that. This is accomplished
with help of Julia's flexible type system and multiple dispatch
(both of which are beyond the scope of this tutorial).

While the images-are-arrays-approach makes working with images in
Julia very performant, it has also been source of confusion to
new community members. This beginner's guide is an attempt to
provide a step-by-step overview of how pixel data is handled in
Julia. To get a more detailed explanation on some particular
concept involved, please take a look at the documentation of the
[JuliaImages](https://juliaimages.org/) ecosystem.

## Multi-dimensional Arrays

To wrap our heads around Julia's array-based treatment of images,
we first need to understand what Julia arrays are and how we can
work with them.

!!! note

    This section is only intended provide a simplified and thus
    partial overview of Julia's arrays capabilities in order to
    gain some intuition about pixel data. For a more detailed
    treatment of the topic please have a look at the [official
    documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/arrays/)

Whenever we work with an `Array` in which the elements are
bit-types (e.g. `Int64`, `Float32`, `UInt8`, etc), we can think
of the array as a continuous block of memory. This is useful for
many different reasons, such as cache locality and interacting
with external libraries.

The same block of memory can be interpreted in a number of ways.
Consider the following example in which we allocate a vector
(i.e. a one dimensional array) of `UInt8` (i.e. bytes) with some
ordered example values ranging from 1 to 6. We will think of this
as our physical memory block, since it is a pretty close
representation.

```jldoctest 1
julia> memory = [0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6]
6-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0x02
 0x03
 0x04
 0x05
 0x06
```

The same block of memory could also be interpreted differently.
For example we could think of this as a matrix with 3 rows and 2
columns instead (or even the other way around). The function
`reshape` allows us to do just that

```jldoctest 1
julia> A = reshape(memory, (3, 2))
3×2 Matrix{UInt8}:
 0x01  0x04
 0x02  0x05
 0x03  0x06
```

Note how we specified the number of rows first. This is because
the Julia language follows the [column-major
convention](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/performance-tips/#Access-arrays-in-memory-order,-along-columns-1)
for multi dimensional arrays. What this means can be observed
when we compare our new matrix `A` with the initial vector
`memory` and look at the element layout. Both variables are using
the same underlying memory (i.e the value `0x01` is physically
stored right next to the value `0x02` in our example, while
`0x01` and `0x04` are quite far apart even though the matrix
interpretation makes it look like they are neighbors; which they
are not).

!!! tip

    A quick and dirty way to check if two variables are
    representing the same block of memory is by comparing the
    output of `pointer(myvariable)`. Note, however, that
    technically this only tells you where a variable starts in
    memory and thus has its limitations.

This idea can also be generalized for higher dimensions. For
example we can think of this as a 3D array as well.

```jldoctest 1
julia> reshape(memory, (3, 1, 2))
3×1×2 Array{UInt8,3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 0x01
 0x02
 0x03

[:, :, 2] =
 0x04
 0x05
 0x06
```

If you take a closer look at the dimension sizes, you can see
that all we did in that example was add a new dimension of size
`1`, while not changing the other numbers. In fact we can add
any number of practically empty dimensions, otherwise known as
*singleton dimensions*.

```jldoctest 1
julia> reshape(memory, (3,1,1,1,2))
3×1×1×1×2 Array{UInt8,5}:
[:, :, 1, 1, 1] =
 0x01
 0x02
 0x03

[:, :, 1, 1, 2] =
 0x04
 0x05
 0x06
```

This is a useful property to have when we are confronted with
greyscale datasets that do not have a color channel, yet we still
want to work with a library that expects the images to have one.

## Vertical-Major vs Horizontal-Major

There are a number of different conventions for how to store
image data into a binary format. The first question one has to
address is the order in which the image dimensions are
transcribed.

We have seen before that Julia follows the column-major
convention for its arrays, which for images would lead to the
corresponding convention of being vertical-major. In the image
domain, however, it is fairly common to store the pixels in a
horizontal-major layout. In other words, horizontal-major means
that images are stored in memory (or file) one pixel row after
the other.

In most cases, when working within the JuliaImages ecosystem, the
images should already be in the Julia-native column major layout.
If for some reason that is not the case there are two possible
ways to convert the image to that format.

```jldoctest 1
julia> At = collect(reshape(memory, (3,2))') # "row-major" layout
2×3 Matrix{UInt8}:
 0x01  0x02  0x03
 0x04  0x05  0x06
```

1. The first way to alter the pixel order is by using the
   function `Base.permutedims`. In contrast to what we have seen
   before, this function will allocate a new array and copy the
   values in the appropriate manner.

   ```jldoctest 1
   julia> B = permutedims(At, (2,1))
   3×2 Matrix{UInt8}:
    0x01  0x04
    0x02  0x05
    0x03  0x06
   ```

2. The second way is using `Base.PermutedDimsArray` which results in a lazy view that
   does not allocate a new array but instead only computes the
   correct values when queried.

   ```jldoctest 1
   julia> C = PermutedDimsArray(At, (2,1))
   3×2 PermutedDimsArray(::Matrix{UInt8}, (2, 1)) with eltype UInt8:
    0x01  0x04
    0x02  0x05
    0x03  0x06
   ```

Either way, it is in general a good idea to make sure that the
array one is working with ends up in a column-major layout.

## Reinterpreting Elements

Up to this point, all we talked about was how to reinterpreting
or permuting the dimensional layout of some continuous memory
block. If you look at the examples above you will see that all
the arrays have elements of type `UInt8`, which just means that
each element is represented by a single byte in memory.

Knowing all this, we can now take the idea a step further and
think about reinterpreting the element types of the array. Let us
consider our original vector `memory` again.

```jldoctest 1
julia> memory = [0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6]
6-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0x02
 0x03
 0x04
 0x05
 0x06
```

Note how each byte is thought of as an individual element. One
thing we could do instead, is think of this memory block as a
vector of 3 `UInt16` elements.

```jldoctest 1
julia> reinterpret(UInt16, memory)
3-element reinterpret(UInt16, ::Vector{UInt8}):
 0x0201
 0x0403
 0x0605
```

Pay attention to where our original bytes ended up. In contrast
to just rearranging elements as we did before, we ended up with
significantly different element values. One may ask why it would
ever be practical to reinterpret a memory block like this. The
one word answer to this is **Colors**! As we will see in the
remainder of this tutorial, it turns out to be a very useful
thing to do when your arrays represent pixel data.


## Introduction to Color Models

As we discussed before, there are a various number of conventions
on how to store pixel data into a binary format. That is not only
true for dimension priority, but also for color information.

One way color information can differ is in the [color
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model) in which they
are described in. Two famous examples for color models are *RGB*
and *HSV*. They essentially define how colors are conceptually
made up in terms of some components. Additionally, one can decide
on how many bits to use to describe each color component. By
doing so one defines the available [color
depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth).

Before we look into using the actual implementation of Julia's
color models, let us prototype our own imperfect toy model in
order to get a better understanding of what is happening under
the hood.

```@example 1
# define our toy color model
struct MyRGB
    r::UInt8
    b::UInt8
    g::UInt8
end
```

Note how we defined our new toy color model as `struct`. Because
of this and the fact that all its components are bit types (in
this case `UInt8`), any instantiation of our new type will be
represented as a continuous block of memory as well.

We can now apply our color model to our `memory` vector from
above, and interpret the underlying memory as a vector of to
`MyRGB` values instead.

```julia-repl
julia> reinterpret(MyRGB, memory)
2-element Vector{MyRGB}:
 MyRGB(0x01,0x02,0x03)
 MyRGB(0x04,0x05,0x06)
```

Similar to the `UInt16` example, we now group neighboring bytes
into larger units (namely `MyRGB`). In contrast to the `UInt16`
example we are still able to access the individual components
underneath. This simple toy color model already allows us to do a
lot of useful things. We could define functions that work on
`MyRGB` values in a color-space appropriate fashion. We could
also define other color models and implement function to convert
between them.

However, our little toy color model is not yet optimal. For
example it hard-codes a predefined color depth of 24 bit. We may
have use-cases where we need a richer color space. One thing we
could do to achieve that would be to introduce a new type in
similar fashion. Still, because they have a different range of
available numbers per channel (because they have a different
amount of bits per channel), we would have to write a lot of
specialized code to be able to appropriately handle all color
models and depth.

Luckily, the creators of `ColorTypes.jl` went a with a more
generic strategy: Using parameterized types and **fixed point
numbers**.

!!! tip

    If you are interested in how various color models are
    actually designed and/or implemented in Julia, you can take a
    look at the
    [ColorTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorTypes.jl)
    package.

## Fixed Point Numbers

The idea behind using fixed point numbers for each color
component is fairly simple. No matter how many bits a component
is made up of, we always want the largest possible value of the
component to be equal to `1.0` and the smallest possible value to
be equal to `0`. Of course, the amount of possible intermediate
numbers still depends on the number of underlying bits in the
memory, but that is not much of an issue.

```jldoctest 1
julia> using ImageCore; # ImageCore reexports FixedPointNumbers and Colors

julia> reinterpret(N0f8, 0xFF)
1.0N0f8

julia> reinterpret(N0f16, 0xFFFF)
1.0N0f16
```

Not only does this allow for simple conversion between different
color depths, it also allows us to implement generic algorithms,
that are completely agnostic to the utilized color depth.

It is worth pointing out again, that we get all these goodies
without actually changing or copying the original memory block.
Remember how during this whole tutorial we have only changed the
interpretation of some underlying memory, and have not had the
need to copy any data so far.

!!! tip

    For pixel data we are mainly interested in **unsigned** fixed
    point numbers, but there are others too. Check out the
    package
    [FixedPointNumbers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FixedPointNumbers.jl)
    for more information on fixed point numbers in general.

Let us now leave our toy model behind and use the actual
implementation of `RGB` on our example vector `memory`. With the
first command we will interpret our data as two pixels with 8 bit
per color channel, and with the second command as a single pixel
of 16 bit per color channel

```jldoctest 1
julia> reinterpret(RGB{N0f8}, memory)
2-element reinterpret(RGB{N0f8}, ::Vector{UInt8}):
 RGB{N0f8}(0.004,0.008,0.012)
 RGB{N0f8}(0.016,0.02,0.024)

julia> reinterpret(RGB{N0f16}, memory)
1-element reinterpret(RGB{N0f16}, ::Vector{UInt8}):
 RGB{N0f16}(0.00783,0.01567,0.02351)
```

Note how the values are now interpreted as floating point numbers.
