# [Supported Operations](@id operations)

Augmentor provides a wide variety of build-in image operations.
This page provides an overview of all exported operations
organized by their main category. These categories are chosen
because they serve some practical purpose. For example Affine
Operations allow for a special optimization under the hood when
chained together.
